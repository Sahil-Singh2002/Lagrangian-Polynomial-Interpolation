# Lagrangian-Polynomial-Interpolation
This has a collection of 3 files in python which help solve problems with interpolation of functions and boundary of there error. This consists of three seperate python files which call on each other to exacute the functions from the likes of poly_interpolation , interpolation _errors and poly_interpolation_2d call on the function lagrange_poly. The function deriv_lagrange_poly is being called by the functions: approximate_derivative and derivative_errors. These algorithsm are used to building as reliable polynomial function which has a small error bound with the actual function f. 

The functions are:
